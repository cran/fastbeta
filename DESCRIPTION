Title: Fast Approximation of Time-Varying Infectious Disease
        Transmission Rates
Description: 
	A fast method for approximating time-varying infectious disease
	transmission rates from disease incidence time series and other
	data, based on a discrete time approximation of an SEIR model, as
	analyzed in Jagan et al. (2020) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008124>.
